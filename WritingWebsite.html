			<h1>Hi! I'm Greg!</h1>
			<p>I am a hobbyist writer and have been producing work for about seven years. I am mostly self-taught, though I 
			have taken a few creative writing classes. A few of my inspirations are listed on the right. I do take a lot of pride 
			in my own work and hope that you enjoy it as well! Happy reading!</p>

			<h1>Top Ten Writing Tips</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Always find a nice quiet place to go write. It is very important to stay focused and avoid distractions. Only then will your best work shine through.</li>
				<li>Speaking of your best work, don't wait for inspiration to strike before sitting down to write. Just do it. Believe it or not, your writing is just 
				as good even if you are not inspired. So don't wait!</li>
				<li>Always be prepared to take criticism. Part of the struggles of being a writer is dealing with criticism from readers and/or editors. Don't let it 
				get your down. Use it to improve and build upon your skills.</li>
				<li>Read. In order to improve, you need to be constantly observing and appreciating the work of others. Other books will both inform and inspire you. Don't miss out!</li>
				<li>Write for yourself first. Do it because you love your craft. Fame will come later. Write what interests you.</li>
				<li>Try to write regularly. It's always good to get a good rhythm going and let your brain get used to producing constantly. It doesn't have to be every day, or even every few days, 
				just do it regularly.</li>
				<li>Mistakes will happen. Let them happen. Your work doesn't have to be (and it won't) perfect the first time. Write first, edit later.</li>
				<li>Everyone has a different way of going about their writing. However, all successful writers plan their work in some way or another before beginning the actual 
				writing process. A good plan will save a lot of time and effort.</li>
				<li>Don't judge your own work in comparison to those more experienced than you. They went through the same grind you are now. In order to reach their level, you must 
				push forward. Only then will you improve.</li>
				<li>On that note, be patient, with yourself and with your audience. It takes time to develop a voice and to speak to your fans. Just keep going as long as your imagination 
				allows it.</li>
